# Smart IoT-based Irrigation System (Blynk)

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of an automated irrigation system that can reap the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as saving time and energy and minimizing water wastage.The system consists of a soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensors, water pump, and other components. When low moisture is detected in the soil, the user gets notified and the water pump turns on automatically. The intelligent system keeps track of sensor data and processes the raw data into useful information. An Arduino UNO WiFi Rev 2 microcontroller is used to manage and send sensor data to the Blynk IoT cloud platform over WiFi. The server synchronizes with the Blynk android application, enabling real-time data visualization through widgets. Moreover, with the use of a Webhook, the application can also channel data to the ThingSpeak server where graphs are generated for analysis and monitoring.
